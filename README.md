We have opted to work on flood and it's resilience.We are trying to automate flood resilience game published by International Institute for Applied System Analysis.
It mainly concentrates on preventive measures and management aspects of floods.
# Flood_Resilience_Game
The Flood Resilience Game is an educational game that allows players to experience, explore, and learn about the flood risk and resilience of communities in river valleys.
The basic outcomes of the game are:
(i) Players experience the effects on resilience of investments in different types of “capital” – such as financial, human, social, built, and natural.
(ii)Players have a better understanding of the influence of preparedness, response, reconstruction on flood resilience.

(iii)Players learn of the benefits of investment in risk reduction before the flood strikes.

(iv)Players explore the complex outcomes on the economy, society and the environment from long-term development pathways.

(v)Players discover the types of decisions needed to avoid creating more flood risk in the future, incentivizing action before a flood through enhancing participatory decision-making.

(vi)Players experience all these complex ideas with a simple and concrete game elements so that participants can connect with their daily realities.

## what?
The game is designed to help participants – such as NGO staff working on flood-focused programs – to identify novel policies and strategies which improve flood resilience.

The game is set for a community living in an area exposed to floods, occurring with different severity. 

The game requires participation of 8-16 players.Players take roles of members of different citizen groups (workers, farmers, entrepreneur, financial services agent), local government and water board officials.

The direct interactions between players create a rich experience that can be discussed, analysed and lead to concrete conclusions and actions. This allows players to explore vulnerabilities and capacities leading to an advanced understanding of interdependencies and the potential for working together.
## why?
The question how to link the development and growth with disaster risk management is not easy. Often problems and solutions for flood-prone communities are focused only on the role of hard infrastructure.

Other aspects, like social, natural, human and financial capital are frequently ignored, and the role of the cooperation sparked by bonds between the community members is underestimated. Also, long-term planning often gives way to immediate actions that lead to improving safety for short time, but fail in the long run.

Understanding resilience is not easy! It requires a change in thinking.
## How?
Games are powerful dissemination instruments; with broader outreach than traditional reports, they provide the perfect avenue to engage participants in exploring the challenge of managing and understanding both flood risk and development.

Simulation games offer an opportunity to communicate such complex realities in a way that’s easy to comprehend.

Players are able to develop strategies, make the decisions and then experience the consequences of their choices in the long run.
